Lyrics
[Verse]
You wear that halo like it’s real
But I know the truth you try to conceal
Sugar on your lips spice in your kiss

[Chorus]
Good naughty girl you’re my secret twist
Good naughty girl can’t resist this risk
Good naughty girl you’re my sweetest sin

[Verse 2]
Your laughter dances in the air
Halo slipping do you even care
Angel by day rebel in the night

[Prechorus]
You’re a mystery wrapped in fire
Fueling every burning desire

[Chorus]
Good naughty girl you’re my secret twist
Good naughty girl can’t resist this risk
Good naughty girl you’re my sweetest sin

[Bridge]
Halo cracked it’s shining dim
But you wear it better when you let me in
Truth and trouble in your eyes
I’m hooked on your sweet disguise
