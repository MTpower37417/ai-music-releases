Lyrics
[Verse]
City lights hum like a lazy tune
Her laugh skips like stones on a lagoon
Sidewalks stretch
But we don't care
Her eyes pull me
There’s magic there

[Prechorus]
Every step’s a little spark
She’s a firefly in the dark

[Chorus]
Sidewalk chemistry
You and me
We’re painting the world so effortlessly
Every glance
Every tease
Sets me free
Sidewalk chemistry
Just let it be

[Verse 2]
She spins once
Her dress catches the breeze
Says
“Catch me
” like she’s teasing the trees
Her smile’s a riddle
Her touch is a clue
The city fades when it’s just us two

[Prechorus]
Every word’s a sugar high
She’s the reason stars collide

[Chorus]
Sidewalk chemistry
You and me
We’re painting the world so effortlessly
Every glance
Every tease
Sets me free
Sidewalk chemistry
Just let it be
